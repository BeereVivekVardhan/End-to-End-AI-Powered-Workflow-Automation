End-to-End AI-Powered Workflow Automation System 🚀

A production-ready AI automation system that combines LLMs, workflow orchestration, and cloud integrations to automate outreach, communication, and tracking — end to end.

Built for real-world use cases such as outreach automation, business workflows, and AI agent orchestration.

Why This Project?

Manual outreach and follow-ups don’t scale. This project shows how to build a fully automated, AI-driven workflow that:

Thinks (AI agents)

Acts (email, logging, follow-ups)

Learns from replies

All with minimal human intervention.

Features

🧠 AI-Powered Data Extraction
Extracts organization names, websites, and key contacts using LLMs.

✍️ Personalized Outreach Emails
Generates context-aware, human-like emails using OpenRouter models.

📤 Automated Email Sending
Sends emails with configurable delays to improve deliverability and avoid spam flags.

🤖 AI-Based Reply Detection & Auto-Response
Detects incoming replies and generates intelligent responses automatically.

📊 Centralized Logging & Tracking
Logs every action, response, and timestamp in Google Sheets.

🔁 Scalable Workflow Design
Modular, reusable, and easy to extend with new triggers or integrations.

🧠 How It Works (High Level)

Workflow is triggered (schedule or event)

AI extracts and structures required data

Personalized outreach email is generated

Email is sent via Gmail API

Replies are monitored and processed by AI

All activity is logged for visibility and auditing
